# 📂 Dataset Information

**Dataset Name:** King County House Sales Dataset (with NaN values)
**Rows:** 21,613
**Columns:** 22
**Target Variable**: price
**_Key Features:_**
**Property size:** sqft_living, sqft_lot
**Structure:** bedrooms, bathrooms, floors
**Quality:** grade, condition
**Location:** zipcode, waterfront, view
**Renovation & construction**: yr_built, yr_renovated

# 🔍 Project Workflow
## 1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding

- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked shape, data types, and summary statistics
- Identified irrelevant and missing data

## 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Removed unnecessary index column (Unnamed: 0)
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Validated numerical and categorical features

## 3️⃣ Missing Value Treatment

**Missing values were found in:**

1. bedrooms
2. bathrooms

**Method Used:**
- Median imputation was applied to preserve data distribution and avoid the impact of outliers.

## 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**EDA was performed using:**
1. Histograms
2. Scatter plots
3. Box plots
4. Correlation heatmaps
**Key Analysis Areas:**
1. Price distribution
2. Relationship between price and living area
3. Impact of bedrooms, bathrooms, and grade
4. Effect of renovation, waterfront, and view
5. Location-based price variation

## 5️⃣ Feature Engineering

- New analytical features were created to improve insights:
- house_age – Age of the house
- is_renovated – Renovation indicator
- price_per_sqft – Fair price comparison metric

## 6️⃣ Segment-Wise Analysis

**Properties were analyzed across:**
- _Budget homes_
- _Mid-range homes_
- _Luxury homes_
- This helped in understanding different pricing behaviors across market segments.

## 7️⃣ Data Visualization Dashboard

- A user-friendly analytical dashboard was built using:
a. Matplotlib
b. Seaborn
- The dashboard clearly communicates insights for non-technical stakeholders.

## 📊 Key Insights

1. Living area (sqft_living) is the strongest price driver
2. Construction grade significantly impacts house prices
3. Bathrooms influence price more than bedrooms
4. Renovated and waterfront properties form premium segments
5. Lot size alone has limited impact on pricing

## 📈 Business Recommendations

1. Focus on improving construction quality rather than increasing bedroom count
2. Renovation offers strong return on investment
3. Waterfront and high-view properties should be marketed as premium assets
4. Buyers should prioritize living area over number of rooms

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

**Limitations:**

- No inflation adjustment
- Location limited to zipcode level
- No predictive modeling included

## **Assumptions:**

- Data reflects fair market conditions
- No major economic fluctuations during the period
